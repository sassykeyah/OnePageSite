    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <main p> Bushfires is a broad term often used to describe an expected grass, forest or scrub fire. In Australia, they are part of the environments natural cycle, forming a complex relationship to both plants and animals. Dry sticks, grass, twigs and leaves can all provide fuel to these fires (The Australian Institute for Disaster Resilience, 2023).
        </main p>
    <main p> Bushfires occur from a variety of different sources, often by natural causes. Although humans can also participate in the creation of a bushfire, on purpose or not (The Australian Institute for Disaster Resilience, 2023). Fires are a part of the bushes ability to renew and produce new life, although for humans, they pose the destruction of life, livelihoods and property. 
        </main p>
     <main p> The cycle of renewal they propose is inherent, encouraging new growth, triggering germination into seeds both in the ground and above. Its destruction also can provide homes, such as hollowed or burnt out trees and logs, which can provide animals areas to nest (NSW Department of Planning and Environment, 2023).
        </main p>
     <main p> Although, in modern day society, there are more drastic consequences. Rising temperatures and an unstable climate means Australia hasn't been able to regulate its natural cycle of bushfires, leading to serious consequences. For example the Black Saturday bushfires, in 2009, which killed 173 people and spread further than 4,500 square kms (National Geographic Society, 2022).
    The effects must be examined to determine how drastic fires may become, and how that reflects the past, and the present.

        <h1>History of Bushfire Impact & Its Effects</h1>
     <main p>Australia's History with Bushfires is vast and dates back thousands of years,  to when the First Nations people, the traditional owners of the land cared and managed it. They used bushfires to renew the land and vegetation, as well as to clear areas to hunt and for spiritual and ceremonial purposes (The Nature Conservecy).</main p>
     <main p>These fires, and the natural burn of bushfires in general create habitat and protect  animals like finches and small marsupials. The backburning and lighting of fires to care for the land kept the dry kindling from building up, and the bushfires from being as destructive and deadly. The indigenous land care kept the bushfires from burning larger, instead burning smaller areas, without obliterating the entire habitat. Without this, wildlife have their entire habitats destroyed, with little to no food or vegetation left. This tool for land management is seen as one of the most prominent in the world due to its intertwining social, spiritual and scientific values. </main>
     <main p>The burnings were controlled down to each aspect, what temperature, the intensity, the size and what ecosystems were targeted (Elodie Fache, Bernard Moizo, 2015). This tool of land management provides connection for First Nations people to their country and has always been fundamental in ensuring "the maintenance of the ancestral domain and thereby the continuation of the socio-cultural domain" (Elodie Fache, Bernard Moizo, 2015). </main>
     <main P> Aboriginal peoples interaction with this form of land care is something that is necessary on a variety of mentioned levels, so significant, its impacts are regarded today. History living on, and altering our perspective on bushfires and their damage. An example of these techniques practised today are by the Kimberley Land Council. They have implemented a program to combat the sudden stop in practise and  burning due to the rapid colonisation of Australia (KLC, 2022). Specifically the program focuses on lighting ‘cool’ fires, the specific technique difference from the western management ways, which are more destructive then renewing. (KLC, 2022).</main>
