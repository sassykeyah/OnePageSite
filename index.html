      <h1>Introduction</h1>  
      
      <main p> Bushfires is a broad term often used to describe an expected grass, forest or scrub fire. In Australia,
        they are part of the environments natural cycle, forming a complex relationship to both plants and animals. Dry
        sticks, grass, twigs and leaves can all provide fuel to these fires (The Australian Institute for Disaster
        Resilience, 2023).
      </main p>
      <main p> Bushfires occur from a variety of different sources, often by natural causes. Although humans can also
        participate in the creation of a bushfire, on purpose or not (The Australian Institute for Disaster Resilience,
        2023). Fires are a part of the bushes ability to renew and produce new life, although for humans, they pose the
        destruction of life, livelihoods and property.
      </main p>
      <main p> The cycle of renewal they propose is inherent, encouraging new growth, triggering germination into seeds
        both in the ground and above. Its destruction also can provide homes, such as hollowed or burnt out trees and
        logs, which can provide animals areas to nest (NSW Department of Planning and Environment, 2023).
      </main p>
      <main p> Although, in modern day society, there are more drastic consequences. Rising temperatures and an unstable
        climate means Australia hasn't been able to regulate its natural cycle of bushfires, leading to serious
        consequences. For example the Black Saturday bushfires, in 2009, which killed 173 people and spread further than
        4,500 square kms (National Geographic Society, 2022).
        The effects must be examined to determine how drastic fires may become, and how that reflects the past, and the
        present.

    <!-- Section 1, History -->
    <div class="wrapper">
      <h1>History of Bushfire Impact & Its Effects</h1>
      <main p>Australia's History with Bushfires is vast and dates back thousands of years, to when the First Nations
        people, the traditional owners of the land cared and managed it. They used bushfires to renew the land and
        vegetation, as well as to clear areas to hunt and for spiritual and ceremonial purposes (The Nature Conservecy,
        2023).</main p>
      <main p>These fires, and the natural burn of bushfires in general create habitat and protect animals like finches
        and small marsupials. The backburning and lighting of fires to care for the land kept the dry kindling from
        building up, and the bushfires from being as destructive and deadly. The indigenous land care kept the bushfires
        from burning larger, instead burning smaller areas, without obliterating the entire habitat. Without this,
        wildlife have their entire habitats destroyed, with little to no food or vegetation left. This tool for land
        management is seen as one of the most prominent in the world due to its intertwining social, spiritual and
        scientific values. </main>
      <main p>The burnings were controlled down to each aspect, what temperature, the intensity, the size and what
        ecosystems were targeted (Elodie Fache, Bernard Moizo, 2015). This tool of land management provides connection
        for First Nations people to their country and has always been fundamental in ensuring "the maintenance of the
        ancestral domain and thereby the continuation of the socio-cultural domain" (Elodie Fache, Bernard Moizo, 2015).
      </main>
      <main P> Aboriginal peoples interaction with this form of land care is something that is necessary on a variety of
        mentioned levels, so significant, its impacts are regarded today. History living on, and altering our
        perspective on bushfires and their damage. An example of these techniques practised today are by the Kimberley
        Land Council. They have implemented a program to combat the sudden stop in practise and burning due to the rapid
        colonisation of Australia (KLC, 2022). Specifically the program focuses on lighting ‘cool’ fires, the specific
        technique difference from the western management ways, which are more destructive then renewing. (KLC, 2022).

      <h1>Present Day Bushfire Impact & Its Effects</h1>
      <main p> Modern Day Australia deals and manages the effects of bushfires differently to the past, but with
        recognition in some areas to the affluence of the First Nations management. It is important to recognise that
        modern Australia hasn't always, and in some places, still do not implement the First Nations land care
        techniques mentioned previously. This effects our current society on a majority of different levels. Bushfire
        management strategies that Aboriginal people have implemented for decades is also a way to connect and involve
        in country and is essential in continuing spiritual, ceremonial and general practises. Without those practises
        being properly enabled, there is both a scientific and cultural loss. </main>
      <main p> On a larger scale, the way indigenous people have managed the land has prevented severe and destructive
        fires for centuries. Without it, the effects of bushfires can become deadly. Fires with increasingly bad effects
        have become "more common in the 20th and 21st centuries, due to changes in land management" (Indigenous
        Knowledge Institute, 2023). Changes including restrictions being placed on areas able to be backburnt due to
        increasing infrastructure and land use. (Indigenous Knowledge Institute, 2023). </main>
      <main p> On a different level, climate change also has increased the effects of today's bushfires. The earth has
        warmed 1.1°C over the past century due to rising Co2 levels in the atmosphere (Stefan Doerr, 2022). This has
        increased the tendency for more warm and dry conditions, making environments much more flammable due to dried up
        vegetation and other dead plants. Fire season, the length of time where fires are more likely to start, has
        "lengthened by 27% globally" (Stefan Doerr, 2022). This is bad news for our current society and we have already
        seen the tragic effects these destructive fires can have. </main>

      <h1>Future Percived Bushfire Impact & Its Effects</h1>
      <main p>Changes in how the land is managed, as well as the climate, mean that Australia's future interaction with bushfires, are not looking too positive. Climate change in particular, will have drastic effects,  increasing both the length and the predictability of bushfires (Adapt NSW, 2023). The severity of these fires will increase due to these factors, which poses a large threat to the lives and infrastructure of Australian people.  </main>
      <main p>The future effects of bushfires have already showcased their deadly capabilities. For example, the 2020/2019 bushfires on the east coast set records for its destruction. Burning a total of over 21% of the forested area, an unprecedented number, more than anywhere seen in the world, let alone Australia (Norman B, Newman P & Steffen W, 2021). These fires effected the air quality of many areas, Canberra registering an air quality index of "4650, more than 23 times the hazardous level" (Norman B, Newman P & Steffen W, 2021). This was similar along the eastern coast, with thick black smoke coating Australia and its communities for months.  </main>
      <main p>By acknowledging the differences in our climate and how it interacts with bushfires, Australia will be able to adapt, changing both how bushfires and handled, and perceived (Adapt NSW, 2023). Although as a society, it requires understanding that the increasing threat of bushfires is directly correlated to climate change. Which is difficult, especially regarding the fact that climate change has played a role in the effects bushfires have had for decades now, this is not a recent issue. It may cost Australia its people and its communities for individuals to be swayed into recognising the link in climate change.  </main>
